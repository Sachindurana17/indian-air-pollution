## 📌 Project Overview
Air pollution poses a critical public health challenge in India. This project analyzes historical air quality data from 26 major cities to identify pollution patterns and forecast PM2.5 levels. It processes raw data from various sources, conducts extensive exploratory data analysis, and deploys a predictive model via an interactive web dashboard.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Automated Data Pipeline:** Scripts merge and preprocess datasets from 26 cities seamlessly.
* **Exploratory Analysis (EDA):** Visually explore seasonality, correlations, and outlier detection.
* **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Compare different algorithms and select the best performing model using Random Forest.
